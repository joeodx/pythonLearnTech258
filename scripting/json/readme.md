## JSON syntax 

- Data is in name/value pairs:

"Name":"value"
```

Curly Braces hold objects:
```
{"Name":"Value"}
```

Data can be seperated by commas 

```
{"Name1": "Value1", "Name2": "Value2"}
```

Square brackets can be used for arrays (lists of data) : 

```
{"name":["Value1", "Value2"} 

```
